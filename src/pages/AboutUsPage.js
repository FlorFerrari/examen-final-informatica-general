It was born in 2021 from a shared vision, a way of perceiving electronic music and music production in general. The space is comprised of Agustin Giri, Emiliano Demarco, Nicolas Parrado, This & That, Xolef, Marvio, Tiello, LKNV, Last Men On Earth, CCINNI, Djolee, and Francisco Garc√≠a. Amancay functions as a record label. Its goal is to release one album per year, featuring a song from each of the artists. In February 2024, we launched FICCIONES III, our latest compilation. ',
